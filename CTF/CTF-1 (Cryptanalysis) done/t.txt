ALICE WAS BEGINNING TO GET VERY TIRED OF SITTING BY HER SISTER ON THE
BANK AND OF HAVING NOTHING TO DO ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD PEEPED INTO THE
BOOK HER SISTER WAS READING BUT IT HAD NO PICTURES OR CONVERSATIONS IN
IT AND WHAT IS THE USE OF A BOOK THOUGHT ALICE WITHOUT PICTURES OR
CONVERSATIONS

SO SHE WAS CONSIDERING IN HER OWN MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD FOR THE
DAY MADE HER FEEL VERY SLEEPY AND STUPID WHETHER THE PLEASURE OF
MAKING A DAISYCHAIN WOULD BE WORTH THE TROUBLE OF GETTING UP AND
PICKING THE DAISIES WHEN SUDDENLY A WHITE RABBIT WITH PINK EYES RAN
CLOSE BY HERh

THERE WAS NOTHING SO VERY REMARKABLE IN THAT NOR DID ALICE THINK IT SO
VERY MUCH OUT OF THE WAY TO HEAR THE RABBIT SAY TO ITSELF OH DEAR OH
DEAR I SHALL BE TOO LATE BUT WHEN THE RABBIT ACTUALLY TOOK A WATCH
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOATPOCKET AND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN HURRIED ON ALICE
STARTED TO HER FEET FOR IT FLASHED ACROSS HER MIND THAT SHE HAD NEVER
BEFORE SEEN A RABBIT WITH EITHER A WAISTCOATPOCKET OR A WATCH TO TAKE
OUT OF IT AND BURNING WITH CURIOSITY SHE RAN ACROSS THE FIELD AFTER
IT AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT POP DOWN A LARGE RABBITHOLE UNDER
THE HEDGE IN ANOTHER MOMENT DOWN WENT ALICE AFTER IT

THE RABBITHOLE WENT STRAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FOR SOME WAY AND THEN
DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN SO SUDDENLY THAT ALICE HAD NOT A MOMENT TO THINK
ABOUT STOPPING HERSELF BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF FALLING DOWN WHAT SEEMED
TO BE A VERY DEEP WELL

EITHER THE WELL WAS VERY DEEP OR SHE FELL VERY SLOWLY FOR SHE HAD
PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HER FIRST SHE TRIED TO
MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING
THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL AND NOTICED THAT THEY WERE
FILLED WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOOKSHELVES HERE AND THERE SHE SAW MAPS AND
PICTURES HUNG UPON PEGS SHE TOOK DOWN A JAR FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS
SHE PASSED IT WAS LABELED ORANGE MARMALADE BUT TO HER GREAT
DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS EMPTY SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DROP THE JAR SO
MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS AS SHE FELL PAST IT

DOWN DOWN DOWN WOULD THE FALL NEVER COME TO AN END THERE WAS NOTHING
ELSE TO DO SO ALICE SOON BEGAN TALKING TO HERSELF DINAHLL MISS ME
VERY MUCH TONIGHT I SHOULD THINK DINAH WAS THE CAT I HOPE
THEYLL REMEMBER HER SAUCER OF MILK AT TEATIME DINAH MY DEAR I WISH
YOU WERE DOWN HERE WITH ME ALICE FELT THAT SHE WAS DOZING OFF WHEN
SUDDENLY THUMP THUMP DOWN SHE CAME UPON A HEAP OF STICKS AND DRY
LEAVES AND THE FALL WAS OVER

ALICE WAS NOT A BIT HURT AND SHE JUMPED UP IN A MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP
BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD BEFORE HER WAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE AND
THE WHITE RABBIT WAS STILL IN SIGHT HURRYING DOWN IT THERE WAS NOT A
MOMENT TO BE LOST AWAY WENT ALICE LIKE THE WIND AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO
HEAR IT SAY AS IT TURNED A CORNER OH MY EARS AND WHISKERS HOW LATE
ITS GETTING SHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND IT WHEN SHE TURNED THE CORNER BUT
THE RABBIT WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN

SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A LONG LOW HALL WHICH WAS LIT UP BY A ROW OF
LAMPS HANGING FROM THE ROOF THERE WERE DOORS ALL ROUND THE HALL BUT
THEY WERE ALL LOCKED AND WHEN ALICE HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE SIDE
AND UP THE OTHER TRYING EVERY DOOR SHE WALKED SADLY DOWN THE MIDDLE
WONDERING HOW SHE WAS EVER TO GET OUT AGAIN

SUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE TABLE ALL MADE OF SOLID GLASS THERE
WAS NOTHING ON IT BUT A TINY GOLDEN KEY AND ALICES FIRST IDEA WAS THAT
THIS MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL BUT ALAS EITHER THE
LOCKS WERE TOO LARGE OR THE KEY WAS TOO SMALL BUT AT ANY RATE IT
WOULD NOT OPEN ANY OF THEM HOWEVER ON THE SECOND TIME ROUND SHE CAME
UPON A LOW CURTAIN SHE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE AND BEHIND IT WAS A
LITTLE DOOR ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES HIGH SHE TRIED THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY
IN THE LOCK AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT IT FITTED

ALICE OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT IT LED INTO A SMALL PASSAGE NOT
MUCH LARGER THAN A RATHOLE SHE KNELT DOWN AND LOOKED ALONG THE PASSAGE
INTO THE LOVELIEST GARDEN YOU EVER SAW HOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF
THAT DARK HALL AND WANDER ABOUT AMONG THOSE BEDS OF BRIGHT FLOWERS AND
THOSE COOL FOUNTAINS BUT SHE COULD NOT EVEN GET HER HEAD THROUGH THE
DOORWAY OH SAID ALICE HOW I WISH I COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE
I THINK I COULD IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN

ALICE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE HALF HOPING SHE MIGHT FIND ANOTHER KEY ON
IT OR AT ANY RATE A BOOK OF RULES FOR SHUTTING PEOPLE UP LIKE
TELESCOPES THIS TIME SHE FOUND A LITTLE BOTTLE ON IT WHICH CERTAINLY
WAS NOT HERE BEFORE SAID ALICE AND TIED ROUND THE NECK OF THE
BOTTLE WAS A PAPER LABEL WITH THE WORDS DRINK ME BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED
ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS

NO ILL LOOK FIRST SHE SAID AND SEE WHETHER ITS MARKED POISON
OR NOT FOR SHE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT IF YOU DRINK FROM A BOTTLE
MARKED POISON IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU SOONER OR
LATER HOWEVER THIS BOTTLE WAS NOT MARKED POISON SO ALICE VENTURED
TO TASTE IT AND FINDING IT VERY NICE IT HAD A SORT OF MIXED FLAVOR OF
CHERRYTART CUSTARD PINEAPPLE ROAST TURKEY TOFFY AND HOT BUTTERED
TOAST SHE VERY SOON FINISHED IT OFF

WHAT A CURIOUS FEELING SAID ALICE I MUST BE SHUTTING UP LIKE A
TELESCOPE

AND SO IT WAS INDEED SHE WAS NOW ONLY TEN INCHES HIGH AND HER FACE
BRIGHTENED UP AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS NOW THE RIGHT SIZE FOR GOING
THROUGH THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN

AFTER AWHILE FINDING THAT NOTHING MORE HAPPENED SHE DECIDED ON GOING
INTO THE GARDEN AT ONCE BUT ALAS FOR POOR ALICE WHEN SHE GOT TO THE
DOOR SHE FOUND SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY AND WHEN SHE
WENT BACK TO THE TABLE FOR IT SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REACH
IT SHE COULD SEE IT QUITE PLAINLY THROUGH THE GLASS AND SHE TRIED HER
BEST TO CLIMB UP ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE TABLE BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY
AND WHEN SHE HAD TIRED HERSELF OUT WITH TRYING THE POOR LITTLE THING
SAT DOWN AND CRIED

COME THERES NO USE IN CRYING LIKE THAT SAID ALICE TO HERSELF RATHER
SHARPLY I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE OFF THIS MINUTE SHE GENERALLY GAVE
HERSELF VERY GOOD ADVICE THOUGH SHE VERY SELDOM FOLLOWED IT AND
SOMETIMES SHE SCOLDED HERSELF SO SEVERELY AS TO BRING TEARS INTO HER
EYES

SOON HER EYE FELL ON A LITTLE GLASS BOX THAT WAS LYING UNDER THE TABLE
SHE OPENED IT AND FOUND IN IT A VERY SMALL CAKE ON WHICH THE WORDS EAT
ME WERE BEAUTIFULLY MARKED IN CURRANTS WELL ILL EAT IT SAID
ALICE AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW LARGER I CAN REACH THE KEY AND IF IT
MAKES ME GROW SMALLER I CAN CREEP UNDER THE DOOR SO EITHER WAY ILL
GET INTO THE GARDEN AND I DONT CARE WHICH HAPPENS

SHE ATE A LITTLE BIT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY TO HERSELF WHICH WAY WHICH
WAY HOLDING HER HAND ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD TO FEEL WHICH WAY SHE WAS
GROWING AND SHE WAS QUITE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT SHE REMAINED THE SAME
SIZE SO SHE SET TO WORK AND VERY SOON FINISHED OFF THE CAKE
